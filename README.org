* Installation

** From Melpa

   Use ~M-x package-install RET grep-context RET~ to install this package.

** Manual

   Install [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash]], then put path to ~grep-context.el~ in your load path:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-dir-containing-grep-context.el>")
   #+end_src
* Usage

  To insert context lines around match at point, call
  ~grep-context-more-around-point~.  To kill context lines, call
  ~grep-context-less-around-point~.

  These commands take a prefix argument that says how many lines to
  insert or kill.

  The easiest way to enable keybindings for these commands in all compilation
  buffers is to use ~grep-context-mode~, where they're bound to ~+~ and ~-~
  keys:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'compilation-mode-hook #'grep-context-mode)
  #+end_src


* Extension

  This package will work with any compilation buffer except it needs
  to know how to format context lines.  If you want to use it in your
  mode, you can add an entry to ~grep-context-line-format-alist~.  You
  can also add an entry to ~grep-context-separator-alist~ to specify a
  separator for non-contiguous regions of context.
